# Concurrent Programming Assignment

## Project Description
A museum reopens after months of closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a safety measure, the museum’s management decided to limit the number of visitors in the museum at one time. The following rules have been set:
1.	The museum opens from 9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. daily.
2.	The museum receives not more than 900 visitors per day.
3.	Not more than 100 visitors are allowed in the museum at one time.
4.	The museum has 2 entrances – South Entrance (SE) and North Entrance (NE); and two exits – East Exit (EE) and West Exit (WE).
5.	Each entrance and exit have 4 turnstiles (T1-T4) for visitors to access through. The turnstiles have sensors to detect visitors entering or leaving the museum.
6.	Visitors use the museum’s mobile app to purchase tickets. The ticketing system refuses the purchase when the daily limit of visitors (900) has been reached.
7.	Tickets will be sold from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. daily.
8.	A control system that integrates with the ticketing system will be built to control visitors’ access to the museum.
